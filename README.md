# dotfiles

My personal set of dotfiles.

## Install

Just one simple step:

```sh
./install.sh
```

## How it works

The install.sh script will recursively loops into the local "home" folder.

For each file found, a link will be created in the `$HOME` directory, keeping of course its subdirectory strucure.
